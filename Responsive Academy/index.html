            <h1>What is Web.Comp?</h1>
            <p class="firstp">
                Web.Comp is a web design competition for school students. We’ll teach you how to build a website as we
                go along, rather than expecting you to be an expert already.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="secondp">
                Web.Comp 2021 has two components:
                <br/>
                <b>Learn</b> is a 4-week series of challenges where students learn as they go along. Each week, we'll
                release interactive notes with the information students will need to complete the week's web design
                challenges. Students earn points for completing probems and claim a place on the leaderboard -
                participants will receive certificates for their results in this competition. The Learn competition
                starts <b>May 10</b>.
                <br/>
                <b>Tournament</b> is a week long competition where students can design their own web pages and submit
                their creations to compete against other students' designs. They can also vote for their favourites. The
                Tournament begins on <b>June 7</b>.

            <h1>Why learn web design?</h1>
            <p class="firstp">
                Every time you use the web, you're seeing HTML and CSS.
                <br/>
                We use websites every day. Creating a functional and well-designed website is one of the most useful
                technical skills you can learn.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="secondp">
                Web.Comp teaches you HTML and CSS, the powerful building blocks needed to build a website from scratch.
                Learning to write HTML and CSS by hand gives you full control over the look and interactivity of your
                site, so you can implement your web designs exactly as you imagined them!

            <p>
                Students learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and how the internet works. We'll also teach them how to apply
                design principles to transform design briefs into digital creations. Recommended for students with
                little or no HTML/CSS experience.

                and cover more advanced topics. We assume students have completed either the Beginners stream, or our
                Intro to HTML course.
